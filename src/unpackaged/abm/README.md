# Programming for Geographical Information Analysis: Core Skills 

This repository contains code written for the Module GEOG 5990M with the School of Geography at the University of Leeds. The aim of the module was to introduce students to coding with the Python Programming language and classes involved building a simple Agent Based Model (ABM). In this repository you will find versions of code from each practical class which builds on from the next to produce the final Agent Based Model (see **Final_ABM.py**).

The model itself has been created to simulate simple behaviours in agents which occur within an environment read in from a **CSV file** (in.text). Behaviours include moving around the environment, eating and haring a store of 'food' with other agents within a set radius. The model has followed an **'object orientated approach'** and thus has involved the creation of an Agent **class** which has a pre-defined the set of bahviours for all of the Agents (see **AgentFramework.py**).
